  abstract = "A major challenge of analyzing the compositional structure of
              microbiome data is identifying its potential origins. Here, we
              introduce fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking
              (FEAST), a ready-to-use scalable framework that can
              simultaneously estimate the contribution of thousands of
              potential source environments in a timely manner, thereby helping
              unravel the origins of complex microbial communities (
              https://github.com/cozygene/FEAST ). The information gained from
              FEAST may provide insight into quantifying contamination,
              tracking the formation of developing microbial communities, as
              well as distinguishing and characterizing bacteria-related health
              conditions.",
